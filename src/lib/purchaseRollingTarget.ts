/**
 * Rolling purchase target — the same rule as the daily sales engine in
 * rollingTarget.ts, one level up: months instead of days.
 *
 * A purchase target is one supplier, a range of months, and a total. Each
 * month inside that range falls into one of two cases:
 *
 * 1. A month that has passed — the target it opened with is locked. What was
 *    bought that month does not change what that month was supposed to buy,
 *    only what is left for the months after it. History never moves.
 *
 * 2. Every month after — whatever is still owed, split evenly:
 *
 *        (total − everything bought so far) ÷ (months left, this one included)
 *
 *    So buying more than a month's target pulls the following months down, and
 *    buying less pushes them up. Clearing the whole target early leaves the
 *    rest at zero rather than going negative - you cannot owe a supplier a
 *    negative amount of buying.
 *
 * The calculation always starts from the total and the raw monthly purchases.
 * No previously shown target is ever fed back in, so the function is pure and
 * every month recomputes correctly after any purchase is added or removed.
