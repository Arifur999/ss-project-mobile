 * What "profit" means in this business - in one place, for every screen.
 *
 * There used to be four answers. For a month with Tk 300,000 gross profit,
 * Tk 100,000 of supplier incentive, no other income and Tk 120,000 of expenses:
 *
 *   Report Summary   Tk 280,000   gross + incentive + other - expenses
 *   Monthly Report   Tk 280,000   same
 *   Yearly Report    Tk 180,000   left the incentive out of every month row
 *   Dashboard        Tk 180,000   never even fetched the incentive
 *   Yearly's own "Profit Achieved" card   Tk 400,000   added the incentive but
 *                                                      not the expenses
 *
 * Three different figures for the same month, Tk 220,000 apart, and the Yearly
 * page disagreed with itself between a card and the column two rows below it.
 *
 * The definition the owner uses is the one the two report pages already had:
 * the supplier incentive (the SP percentage given back on purchases) is
 * earnings, so it belongs with the sales profit and the other income, and
 * expenses come off the total. Every screen now calls these functions rather
 * than re-deriving it, which is what stops the four from drifting again.
