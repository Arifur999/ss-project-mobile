// same eleven tables out as dated rows with a running balance.
//
// The rule that matters more than any other: the closing balance here MUST be
// the figure Balance.tsx shows for the same account. Two screens disagreeing
// about the money in one drawer is the worst outcome this file can produce, so
// every source below is added with the same sign and the same filter as
// Balance.tsx:116-141, and the test beside this asserts the two agree.
