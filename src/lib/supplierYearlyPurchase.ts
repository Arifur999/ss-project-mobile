// This is the sheet the owner has kept by hand: what was ordered, what the
// supplier gave back as incentive, what is therefore owed, and what actually
// left the till.
//
// Pure on purpose - it takes rows that have already been fetched and returns
// rows, so the arithmetic can be tested without a page or a network. Three
// consumers read the result (the chart, the twelve rows, the total), and a
// single source is what stops them disagreeing about a month.
//
// YearlyReport.tsx:234-244 computes three of these four figures already and
// renders none of them. It is the intended second caller - but adopting this
// module there would move its Total Purchases, because its order value leads
// with net_amount where this one leads with the item lines, and through
// profitInputs that would move its Profit/Loss too. That is a change of its
// own, not a side effect of this one.
